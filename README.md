# Project 1 Pitch

## Elevator Pitch
TikType is a game for people who want to increase their touch-typing speed and accuracy. 
A player is given a word they must type correctly before a timer runs out. 
The game will progress, as longer words are added and time decreases. 

## Tech Stacks
* Vanilla Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Maybe: Web Audio API

## MVP Goals
* A target word is displayed on screen
* User keyboard input is tracked and compared against the target
* An accurate timer counts down
* Player wins round if they can type the target word before timer ends
* If timer ends before game over

## Stretch Goals
* Ticking sound for timer
* Typing sound : positive for correct in sequence negative sound for out of sequence. 
* Some minimal background music
* animation for timer
* touch typing beginner tutorial rounds
* animated Keyboard highlighting where to press
* Tutorial for finger positioning for correct typing technique. 
* Animation: Words float down

## Roadblocks
* Finding the best way to structure game logic
* Animation could get confusing
* Setting MVP priority first
